## Question 1

**Compare and contrast the data types used for:**
- `country.Population`
- `country.LifeExpectancy`

Why were these data types selected?

### Answer
`country.Population` is stored as an integer data type and represents the whole-count of people, so decimals are not needed.
`country.LifeExpectancy` is stored as a decimal data type, which is appropriate as life expectancy is a statistical average.

### Screenshot

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```

## Question 2

**What is the data type of `country.IndepYear`?**
Why do you think this data type was selected?

### Answer
The data type of `country.IndepYear` is `smallInt`. `smallInt` is used to optimize database performance and storage efficiency. 

### Screenshot

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```

## Question 3

**Make a case for a different data type for `country.IndepYear`.**
Explain why your proposed data type might be better in some situations.

### Answer
I believe `YEAR` would be better in some situations because you could leverage built-in SQL date and time funtions for extraction, comparison, or calculations. Queries could be more straightforward compared to using `country.IndepYear`.
